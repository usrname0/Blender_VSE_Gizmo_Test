description = """‚ö†Ô∏è EXPERIMENTAL VERSION 2.0.0 ‚ö†Ô∏è

An experimental rewrite of BL Easy Crop using Blender's gizmo system instead of modal operators. This version serves as a foundation for a future "Free Transform" extension.

üî¨ What's Different:
‚Ä¢ Uses Blender's gizmo system (like native transform tools)
‚Ä¢ Experimental implementation that may not work as expected
‚Ä¢ Foundation for future advanced transform features
‚Ä¢ Extensive debug tools for development

üéØ Purpose:
‚Ä¢ Learning exercise for gizmo system
‚Ä¢ Foundation for Free Transform extension
‚Ä¢ Alternative approach to crop interaction
‚Ä¢ Research into sequence editor gizmo capabilities

‚öôÔ∏è Features:
‚Ä¢ Gizmo-based crop handles (experimental)
‚Ä¢ Debug panel with testing tools
‚Ä¢ Coordinate transformation utilities
‚Ä¢ Tool system integration
‚Ä¢ Fallback to v1.0 modal approach

üö® Important Notes:
‚Ä¢ This is EXPERIMENTAL software
‚Ä¢ Gizmo system is poorly documented
‚Ä¢ May not work reliably
‚Ä¢ Install alongside v1.0 for fallback
‚Ä¢ Uses X key (not C) to avoid conflicts
‚Ä¢ Requires Blender 4.2+ for best gizmo support

üí° For Production Use:
Install the stable v1.1.0 version instead. This v2.0.0 is for developers and experimenters only.

üîß Debug Features:
‚Ä¢ Gizmo registration checker
‚Ä¢ Coordinate transformation testing
‚Ä¢ Test strip creation
‚Ä¢ Matrix calculation verification
‚Ä¢ Poll condition debugging
