# BL Easy Crop

BL Easy Crop lets you click and drag handles to crop in Blender's Visual Sequence Editor / preview window.
With this extension Blender's built-in crop looks and behaves a bit more like the other transforms: rotate, scale, move and transform.
It can be accessed via the preview window toolbar, menus or keyboard shortcut (default "C").

Credit to the old https://github.com/doakey3/VSE_Transform_Tools for numerous bits of help while trying to get this thing to work.

## Troubleshooting

It should just work right away after installing.  If the addon doesn't appear after installation:
1. Make sure you're using Blender 4.4 or newer
2. Check the console for any error messages
3. Try restarting Blender after installation
