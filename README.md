# VSE Gizmo Test (random N-panel test buttons.)

#UPDATE
VSE gizmos are working. I got a gizmo working the 3d editor and was trying to make a script that proves they work in one place and not the other.  So while trying to prove that VSE gizmos don't poll and accidentally got it working.  Will advise when I figure out what I'm doing.
