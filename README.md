# VSE Gizmo Test (random N-panel test buttons.)

#UPDATE
This was originally where I had a few example files and comments about difficulties getting Blender gizmos to work in the VSE.  While writing a script to prove that VSE gizmos don't poll I accidentally got it working!  If someone in the future is searching for working examples you can find an example of VSE gizmos working here: https://github.com/usrname0/BL_EasyCrop
